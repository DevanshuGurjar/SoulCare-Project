# SoulCare-Project
The platform integrates Conversational AI using the LLaMA language model, sentiment  analysis to detect emotional tone, and a responsive web interface built with React and  Next.js for a seamless user experience.  SoulCare is not a replacement for medical professionals but acts as a first-level support  system.
